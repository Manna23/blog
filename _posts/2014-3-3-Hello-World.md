title: The Hackathon Diaries
---
*Note: The Title is self-explanatory, isn't it ?
Yes, you got it right. This blog is a gist of all my experiences at 20 odd Hackathons that I have participated in. Please do not consider it as an exhaustive Hackathon 101 guide to secure wins, yet if you manage to reach the end, I am pretty sure your upcoming hackathons won't be the same again. People have been pushing me to pen down everything I know and have learned from Hackathons, so here it is . 
First thing first, let's lay the foundation.
## What are these Hackthons ?
In a nutshell, Hackathons are typically Coding marathons which run for a non-stop duration of 24 hours. Depending on the hackathon, you are required to participate as a Team or a invidual. During these 24 hours, you are supposed to brainstorm a viable idea and build a functional and demoable implementation of the same. Interesting, right ? So, what's the catch, you may ask. Well, read on.
## The Takeaways 
1. Exiting Cool Goodies and other swags.
2. The Winning prize are very cool and huge (From Macs to Lakhs of Cash Prizes) 
3. Jobs (Commonly known as Hiring hackathons)
But apart from all the above mentioned lucrative reasons to attend hackathons, the most important catch is that 24 hour of fun, learning and Intense Coding **Experience**. That's what you actually take back no matter you win or loose. Also, you get to know and collaborate with some of the brightest and like minded brains in the country , let alone meeting with high profile personalities in the tech-industry. And just in case you are lucky enough, you can make a friend out of a stranger in those very 24 hour [In my case it was Rohan Prinja aka Wenderen].  
Notably, if you you could also walk away with your own Startup idea with a functional prototype at your disposal.
